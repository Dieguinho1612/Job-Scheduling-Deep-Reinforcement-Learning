    "# Description of Notebook\n",
    "In this Notebook we will create the states for the Job Scheduling Problem in the deterministic case.<br>\n",
    "In every non-final state an action can be taken, leading to one of the successor states. Therefore, we construct a function that computes every possible state of a given problem environment by representing it with an initial state and iteratively transitioning to every feasible successor state.<br> Here, a state corresponds to a moment in a schedule in which a decision has to be taken, i.e. a Machine becomes free. The actions therefore consist of turning it off or assigning a Job to it. Since we approach this problem from the perspective of Deep Q-Learning, every state needs a Q-value for every feasible action. These will induce the target values. Finally, we will define a composite function executing all these steps.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Policies can be deduced from the states and their Q-values. These are equivalent to scheduling rules. A function will be given to compute the optimal as well as a random Policy."

    "The idea is that the Machines will be processing the Jobs. Whenever a Job finishes, a Machine gets free and therefore an action has to be taken. This situation will be represented with a State.<br>\n",
    "Feasible actions in this state are to assign a pending Job to the free Machine or to shut it down, which means it cannot be used anymore from here on.<br>\n",
    "If all Jobs have been assigned and/or processed already, the state is final and no decision has to be taken.<br>\n",
    "In case that more than one Machine is free at some point, we will always use the free Machine with the lowest index first. After having taken an action on it, it is not free anymore and we move to the next state, which will happen to have the same time, to take care of the next free Machine."
